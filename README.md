Semantic Hacker Feeds Reader
=====================

USC football feed aggregator using Semantic Hacker API - (very old)

App fetches news on USC football from a few resources and then pipes that text into the Semantic Hacker APIs which extracts keywords.  Using the keywords I would then pull pictures and videos from Flickr.
